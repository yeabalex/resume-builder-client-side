# Full Stack Resume Builder

This is a comprehensive full-stack resume builder application built using modern web technologies and cloud services. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on professional resumes with ease. Users can create new resumes, view existing ones, update their content, and delete outdated versions, providing full control over their resume management process.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Services**: (AWS, Google Cloud)

## Features

- User-friendly interface for creating and editing resumes
- Real-time preview of resume changes
- Secure user authentication and data storage
- Cloud-based storage for easy access across devices
- Export options, including PDF and various document formats

## Future Features

I am constantly working to improve and expand the capabilities of the Resume Builder. Here are some exciting features I plan to add in the future:

- Multiple resume templates to choose from, allowing users to select the design that best suits their professional style and industry
- AI-powered content suggestions to help users optimize their resumes
- Integration with professional networking platforms for easy import of work history and skills

## Database

It utilizes PostgreSQL as its primary database system. Here are some key points about the database implementation:

- I use PostgreSQL to efficiently store and manage user data, resume content, and template information.

- The database is designed with scalability in mind, capable of handling a growing number of users and resumes.

- Implemented an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with our database, specifically using Prisma.
